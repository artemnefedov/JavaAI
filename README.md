## The JavaAI Java SDK is a non-official open source library that allows Java developers to interact with OpenAI models with just a few lines of code.

#### Note:
> I wrote this library for myself because I couldn't find anything more convenient, so I decided to share my project with the community. I hope that I can help someone.
Any help is welcome, I am always open to new ideas and criticism.

## How to use it?


### 1. Import the library into your project.

_The package released to [Maven Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.artemnefedov/javaai/0.2.3/)_

#### Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.artemnefedov</groupId>
    <artifactId>javaai</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```
#### Gradle:
```groovy
implementation group: 'io.github.artemnefedov', name: 'javaai', version: '0.2.3'
```
#### or download the JAR file from the [releases page](https://github.com/artemnefedov/JavaAI/releases)

### 2. Get the API key on the OpenAI website.
[openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

### 3. Initialize the language model in your project.
```java
Completions completions = new Completions("YOUR_OPEN_AI_API-KEY");
```
#### Check out the [Wiki page](https://github.com/artemnefedov/JavaAI/wiki) for other ways

### 4. Set the query parameters and get the result from the OpenAI model.

```java
String result = completions.generateText("What is the first line programmers print?");
```
**Conclusion:** `The first line a programmer typically prints is "Hello World!"`
